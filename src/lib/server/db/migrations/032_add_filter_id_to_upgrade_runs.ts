 * Migration 032: Add filter_id to upgrade_runs table

 * Replaces the cooldown_hours column with filter_id.
 * The cooldown system now uses filter-level tags instead of time-based cooldown.
 *
 * - Adds filter_id TEXT column to track which filter was used
 * - cooldown_hours is deprecated but kept for backwards compatibility
