 * Migration 046: Change quality profile sync to use profile_name instead of profile_id
 *
 * The PCD schema uses name as the stable key for quality profiles. The sync table
 * was using the ephemeral auto-increment id, which could break across cache rebuilds.
 *
 * Since we can't look up profile names from the PCD cache at migration time,
 * existing selections are dropped. Users will need to re-select their quality
 * profiles in sync config once.
